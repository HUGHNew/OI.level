standard process
1. word segment
2. word2vec
3. train
   1. RNN/LSTM(model)
4. test

## progress

- MNIST
- NLP basis
  - word participle
    - dictionary based
    - Markov
    - Hidden Markov
  - word embedding | word2vec (usage)

## roadmap

- [x] kickoff: https://hughnew.github.io/RDLog/schedule/2022/10/02/NLP-july.22.html
- [x] 一些材料(CS224n): https://hughnew.github.io/RDLog/course/2022/10/06/CS224n-kickoff.html
- [x] MNIST: ~/PythonSpace/mnist
- [ ] Quick view for more basis: [OpenBMB course][obmb] due: 10.20
- [ ] IMDB: simple task for practice due: 10.17
- [ ] LSTM & RNN: [normal course][BN] due: 10.15
- [ ] CS224n long-term task: for further development
